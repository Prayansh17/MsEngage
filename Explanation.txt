So I have implemented my webapp with the help of python-django web-framework and django-channels webRTC and websockets.


Directory structure:
Root
   --mysite
       --accounts(webapp used for accounts(django authenticaton system)
                  Using can find login and Signup html files under templates of this app which are extended from
                  base.html in main directory using template rendering.
                  Signup and html views and urls can be found in views.py and urls.py which are further included
                  in main website urls in mysite.
                )
       --chat (This is the webapp actually used for creating the video call functionality using django-channels
                and websockets and you can find all the users views in consumers.py file which is pretty much
                similar to views.py(consumers is used specially for django channels)
                )
       --mysite(this is main website project through which website starts)
            ---asgi.py ((Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface : to unite channels with django apps)
            ---settings.py (all the settings regarding the hosts, apps, urls_configs, databases and integration of
                            static and templates files to the apps).
            ---urls.py (contains all the urls which the website may have including homepage(obvious))
            ---views.py (majorly consists of template views from templates which are directly used).
            ---wsgi.py (no use for now)

       --static(contains all css and js files)
            ---css
            ---js(these are for apps)
            ---mysite(files inside these are for basic templates which doesn't belong to app eg(homepage))

       --templates (contains all basic html files)
       --db.sqlite3 (manages django database)
       --manage.py (used to run django server)



How peer to peer connection is established??
    Session description protocol(SDP) : Information about a peerthat other peer needs in order to make peer-to-peer
                                        connection.
    Signalling (using django server) required to exchange sdps.
    Both peers connect to signalling server using websocket.
    After SDPs are exhanged from both sides, p2p connection can be established.
    Signalling is not required afterwards

    How it functions??
        1. Peer joins room
        2. send message to all others peers.
        3. all other peers get notified of new peer (message in console).
        4. each existing peer initiates peer connection with new peer(offer sdp).
        5. new peer recieves each offer sdp and send the responses(answer sdp for each offer).
        6. other peers receive answer spds.
        7. New peer is connected!
